TODO (Things that COULD, SHOULD or even MUST be done)
--------------------------------------------------------

* Create nonce according to suggestion in RFC 2617
* I chose to build strings using '+'. This is a trade-off. You could also use the append function.
* Storing passwords
	The server may store pairs consisting of username and H(A1).
* Log invalid requests
	If the request digest is invalid, then a login failure should be logged, since repeated login failures from a single client may indicate an attacker
	attempting to guess passwords.
* qop
	I only supported "auth" quality of protection.
	You may want to consider "auth-int" too.
* Algorithms
	The most recent attacks on MD5 render it largely obsoloete. Specification [3] - which, if approved, obsoletes RFC 2617 - defines the following algorithms:
		SHA-256 (mandatory to implement)
     		SHA-512/256 (backup)
     		MD5 (only for backward compatibility!)
	You may also want to implement the *-sess variants.
* uri
	The server MUST assure that the resource designated by the "uri" diretive i sthe same as the resource specified in the Request-Line;
	if they are not, the server SHOULD return a 400 Bad Request error.
* Note that there are specifications which (could) obsolete RFC 2617.
* Interaction with shared caches / Cache-Control.
* Proxy-Authentication and Proxy-Authorization
